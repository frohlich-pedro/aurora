# aurora
aurora is a completely new kernel, it's not a Linux nor a BSD, it's a complete new kernel from scratch, the name comes from my cat RIP. so i wanted to imortalize her by naming my kernel after her.

# how to run
just go to the root directory (aurora/) and run "gmake clean && gmake run".

after that you can enjoy the kernel. :)
