# AURORA
Aurora is a completely new kernel, it's not a Linux nor a BSD, it's a complete new kernel from scratch, the name comes from my cat RIP. so i wanted to imortalize her by naming my kernel after her.

## How to Run
Just enter src/ (where is located Makefile) then just:
```sh
make clean && make all
```
