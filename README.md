# Aurora
Aurora is a completely new kernel, it's not a Linux nor a BSD, it's a complete new kernel from scratch, the name comes from my cat (RIP Aurora). so i wanted to imortalize her by naming my kernel after her. \
Don't expect it to be the new Linux, since i'm a 17y boy who's alone in this project. i accept critics btw
